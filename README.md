Welcome to the repository for my CMPG 323 Overview project1. 
This repository serves as a single point for managing CMPG 323 projects, assignments, and trainings. 
Important information on the structure of this repository, the branching process, and standards for safeguarding sensitive 
material may be found below.

# The Structure of My Repository

   For each project, I will create a separate repository. Each repository will contain all the necessary code, 
   documentation, and resources specific to that project. This approach will helps me keep our work organized and focused.
    My This Semester Projects Are:
    
    1. Project 1: CMPG 323 Overview(Agile & Scrum)
    2. Project 2: (API Development)
    3. Project 3: (Design Standards & Patterns)
    4. Project 4: (Testing & RPA)
    5. Project 5: (Reporting & Monitoring)
  
# Project and Repository Integration 
      
    ![archie](https://github.com/Madzivhandila/CMPG-323-Overview---30332338/assets/75025282/c9a3444a-92fd-448c-a439-edb6ea3e901c)



   The above diagram depicts the link between projects and repositories. Each project has its own repository, which allows 
   us to separate project-specific work. This integration ensures that each project's modifications are contained within 
   its repository.
   
     
   -Tabular View Board
          created Labels
           -	Class
           -	Project
           -	Training
           
           Tabular View Board provides a table-based representation of our tasks. were it has fields like Milestone, 
           Label, Linked Pull Request, and Repository. The field Assignees is covered up.
           
           Under this Board thats were I included:
           
            -	All CMPG 323 classes
            -	All CMPG 323 training time required to upskill and complete projects
            -	All estimated tasks required to complete all CMPG 323 projects
            -	All CMPG 323 project submissions (with deadlines attached to milestones)
            -	All tasks associated to completing the CMPG 323 Portfolio of Evidence (POE)

  -Sprint View(board)
          Under this board view I added all 8 of the sprints with sprint start and end date as folow: 
        
          -Start of classes + Sprint 1 (17 Jul - 28 Jul)
          -Sprint 2 (31 Jul - 11 Aug)  
          -Sprint 3 (14 Aug - 25 Aug)
          -Sprint 4 (28 Aug - 8 Sept)
          -Sprint 5 (11 Sept - 22 Sept)
          -Sprint 6 (25 Sept - 6 Oct)
          -Sprint 7 (9 Oct - 20 Oct)
          -Sprint 8 (23 Oct - 3 Nov)
    
 -Linked Assessment View 
      I used Linked Assessment as it allows me to group and organize tasks based on their linked assessments.
      I used this field to associate tasks with specific assessments related to the CMPG 323 course.
      This can be extremely useful for tracking the progress of tasks associated with different assessments, ensuring that 
      all required tasks for a particular assessment are completed, and having a clear overview of the work required for 
      each assessment.

      In this view, you might expect to see:

         1. Tasks: Each task represents a specific piece of work that needs to be done. These tasks are related to a 
            particular assessment, and the view groups them based on this association.
         
         2. Assessment Groups: The tasks will likely be grouped by the assessment they are linked to. This grouping 
            provides a visual representation of which tasks are part of each assessment.
         
         3. Deadlines: If the assessments have deadlines, you might want to include them in this view to ensure that tasks 
             are completed on time.
         
         4. Progress: You can track the progress of each assessment by looking at the completion status of the associated 
            tasks.
         
 -Status View(board)
       Status view provide an overview of tasks based on their status, which allows you to track the progress of work 
       items in your projects.

       Common column names you might find in a "Status View" include:

       1. ToDo: Tasks that are planned but not yet started.
       2. In Progress: Tasks currently being worked on.
       3. Review: Tasks that are awaiting review.
       4. Done: Completed tasks.
       
  
# branching Strategy

      To handle any changes, we'll utilize a branching strategy for each extend. Each venture repository's major 
      branches will incorporate:
    
        1.Primary branching Strategy -The most branch, which speaks to the foremost later steady form.
        2.The development branch -The department in which highlights are incorporated and tried some time recently being 
          consolidated into the most department.
        3.Branches of intrigued -Planned for certain capacities or obligations. These branches are based on create and 
          will be blended back in once the highlight is wrapped up.

 # .Gitignore File

  A gitignore file that Git store arrangement record that indicates which records and registries ought to be disregarded 
  and not checked by adaptation control. It is utilized to channel out objects such as built doubles, logs, brief
  records, private information, IDE/editor-specific records, and other made records. The objective is to preserve the 
  store clean, dodge the consideration of touchy fabric by mischance, and ensure that no unneeded records are committed.

# Storage of Credentials and Sensitive

    To protect sensitive data repository selected as private and I only be shared it with my lectures only . 
    This practice ensures that sensitive information remains private and does not pose a security risk.
